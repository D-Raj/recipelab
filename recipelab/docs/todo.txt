Fraction input
    Current quantity box lets non numbers through, which causes an error on lookup.  Force input type to number.
        Strange - accept_ingredient function should be parsing number...  Maybe the float function is too accepting.
    Fraction buttons should put fraction in box...

Try without signup
    Done! Keep recipe during signup process?  Not compatible with django-registration?
    Done! Bypass the problem by storing the recipe fields in a cookie and then restoring them after login?
    Done! Store user id in '#user_id' if registration form validated OK.
    Done! Also, don't let user save target unless registered.
    Done! Nav bar visibility : My Recipes and Logout should go visible, Log In should go hidden.
    Done! Make everything visible in base.html and then turn on/off the options using jQuery visibility, kludge.
    Done! CSRF token is invalid after login using modal window - capture it from returned html after registration and update the hidden form control?
    Done! Change Target buttons should give a warning to sign up.

    Freemium model to be rethought.
        Maybe: Trial, TrialEnded and Subscriber types.  TrialEnded can see their saved Recipes but not save new ones (just disable button).
        Also, disable the "My Recipes" button if the Trial is expired - a bit nasty?

        Done! Set up corporate email
        Done! Test sign registration page
        Done! activation-related templates need some bootstrap finesse (especially div.container)
              Text should be made user friendly as well!
        Creating a new account via registration doesn't create a userprofile or assign a default target...  maybe that's what's causing New Recipe page to throw lots of errors.
        Should not be possible to request more than one free trial or account from a single email address.
        You should not get registration page if you are already logged in...  Maybe redirect?

    When registering a new user:
        create new user profile, attach default nutritional target
        set user profile status to trial, and record user join date
        when using any page, verify that user is valid (if it's a trial user, check join date)
            Redirect to sorry page if subscription is not valid.
        view for fastspring callback will update user profile status - get callback after subscription changes (will have user ID as reference number)
        make sure the support email address is valid, in case there are any issues
        no need to hold subscription data?

    Need a "My Account Details" page, linked to from Navbar.
        Nice to have: Need a process for changing email address - the userprofile table could hold the new email and a link gets emailed out to the new address - upon confirmation click that new email becomes effective...?

    GO PRO! (?)
        Consider adding an Add Recipe button.
            To make this work efficiently, should snapshot the nutrition values whenever you save a recipe and store them in?
            Nutrients table with a Foreign Key linked to the recipe.
            Add recipe should open a popup where you select the number of servings...
            Add a radio button to select Recipe or Menu.

    Nice to get energy balance (fat / protein / carb).

    Would be nice if it prevented you from adding the same ingredient twice - just replace the existing one if that occurs.
        Solo mode doesn't quite work correctly when there are two of the same ingredient - they both get used to calculate nutrition, but only one of them is non-blanked out.

    Values don't add up.  For instance, the different fat type values don't add up to the total amount of amount.
        To avoid number that don't add up, hide the total carbs and total fat numbers?


    ---

    Better DB matches
        Add a field to FOOD_DES which contains the singularized form of each word in Long_Desc.  That way we're matching singular vs. singular at all times.

    Weird back-button behavior:
        Double-click on an ingredient to get modal popup.
        Close modal popup.
        Click on New recipe.
        Click on back-button.
        You get the json data from the food match box!


    ---------------------
    Word lookup ???
    Add a new table - Words
    This will have many-to-many relationship with sr17 - the many to many entries will each have a weight representing the comma-sep distance
    Will have a many-to-many relationship with ingredients
    Each word in Words will be singularized, and the word field will be indexed.
    Should cover issues:
        All 'words' have been singularized, but this is not true of the sr17 entries.  Cherry will not match cherries in database!
        Handle multi-word food term aliases.
        Deal with spelling mistakes - maybe use a plugin?

    ---------------------

    Missing Omega 3,6.
        Not so easy, according to:
            http://discourse.soylent.me/t/making-sense-of-usda-database-essential-fatty-acids-18-3-undifferentiated-etc/18662/3
        Some acids are listed separately, can you simply sum them?
            EPA, DHA...?

    Should have option to disregard an ingredient - this might turn it yellow?



----------------------------------

    
Done:
    Easy: Length of entry should lower the priority a bit.
    Easy: plural form of word should work the same way.
    Easy: Get a bingo boost if the first word in the entry matches one or more of your words.
        Lower priority if you have additional non-matching words...?  Top hit for "orange juice" is "Orange Pineapple Juice Blend"
    Easy: we now attempt to pluralize, we should singularize as well.  Do this for number words and units as well!!!

	You can easily have two numbers in a row: "2 dozen", "three quarters", "one third".

	Handle fractions.
	
	>>> parse_numbers_words('five testing one two three')
	('five testing two three', 1.0, ['two', 'three'])
	    Since we're checking the number_terms in order, the priority is given to "one" instead of "five".
	        We should be searching in ingredient string word order!
	
	    Just singularize every word in the search string before further action - avoid the overhead of checking both singularized and pluralized words.

    Must match unit and quantity terms as full words and not substrings, to avoid matching the l in apple.
        unit terms can have their words in any order - number words must be in correct order

    Check food aliases using whole word match (single word only is supported)
	
    Handle number + fraction, like "2 1/2" and "2Â½"

    Tying it all together with FOOD_DES
#        Mass unit found in s, simply use that.
#        Vol unit found in s, get best ingredient match
            check all entries in WEIGHT against s
                try to match adjectives like shredded first (what's left after you remove quantity-only words from a WEIGHT entry)
                If you don't find a "great match", look for any volume units in WEIGHT entries - grab the first one you find
                what if there are no volume units in WEIGHT entries? Look for non-volume units that are still in quantity_only_terms, try to find match (e.g. 'can')
                Finally, check if 'piece' is the effective unit - try to match first comma-sep term of WEIGHT entry with FOOD_DES.Long_Des.

    Easy: boost for if any comma-sep term matches "raw" exactly.

    Test total_conversion and new version of food_parse.

	Volume/mass
	Must be able to convert between any user-entered quantity to: 1) preferably a unit in the lookup table, or  2) grams.
	Implementation: 
	    Make a new conversion table.  Best-match between the user-entered quantity to that conversion table, and best-match the FOOD_DES entries to that table too.
	        What if the user-entered quantity units match an entry in the WEIGHT table for that FOOD_DES item directly - no need for best-match...
	        If user entered volume, and sr17 has mass only, convert based on assumed density of water...?
	    If the first comma-sep word in the WEIGHT entry is contained in the FOOD_DES entry, assume that WEIGHT entry is for "item".

    Current approach for getting sr17 food list in ingredient detail view will fail if we tweak the match logic to the point where
    the stored ingredient-food match item no longer shows up in the top 50 sr17 entries.

http://stonedesigns.net/2013/02/creating-an-editable-list-with-html5-jquery/
    Doesn't split up content with carriage returns that you paste in
    Should be able to add icons and links...?  Maybe just using css styling
    
    You can detect content chances using this:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1391278/contenteditable-change-events
    Apparently the "on" works for IE11+, but why not use more basic jQuery?
    
    $('body').on('focus', '[contenteditable]', function() {
        var $this = $(this);
        $this.data('before', $this.html());
        return $this;
    }).on('blur keyup paste input', '[contenteditable]', function() {
        var $this = $(this);
        if ($this.data('before') !== $this.html()) {
            $this.data('before', $this.html());
            $this.trigger('change');
        }
        return $this;
    });

    Better: https://github.com/makesites/jquery-contenteditable/blob/master/jquery.contenteditable.js

    Can you decorate the li with classes, and make them clickable?

Ingredients widget - jQuery mobile editable list
    Hitting enter key adds item to list on stand-along page, but collapses the widget on recipelab page.
    Need to add icons to the left of ingredients to indicate their status - looking up, success, failure. - add img tag inside list item (see docs)
    Start ajax lookup when the item gets added to the list.
    Make ingredients clickable - get a modal popup with details and/or how to fix.
    Edit button has blue glow and holds focus after you click on it (it changes to Done).
    Optional: Make it not collapsible: according to docs, it must currently be in a container with data-role="collapsible"
    After creating or deleting new item, should call a callback() - this will fire up ajax call and/or modify the nutrition matrix so far.
    Should come up in edit mode if you're adding new, or in view mode if you're viewing existing recipe.

    Currently getting brand name items in lookup for "1 cup sugar". Fixed - now using decode function instead of parse_food to get rid of "1 cup", and decreased brand name min chars from 3 to 2.

    Make sure we're ignoring single letter words, can easily be caused by apostrophes...? Fixed

    Db lookup
        for "3 eggs", "Egg, yolk, dried" ranked higher than "Egg, whole, raw, fresh"   - maybe "whole" should be added to the cooking-word list

    Unit for ingredient detail view

    Submit ingredient PKs along with the recipe form, don't look up ingredients that have no changes.

    Unit shows up as "None" on tooltip if none was found (for egg).
        Why doesn't it match "large" for egg?

    The colour-coding of ingredients on the recipe form should simply correspond to whether the user has checked them!
        Current implementation is one-better than that!  user-verified is green, good match is yellow and poor match is red

    If you select another ingredient on the popup, and the matched unit is still available on the new ingredient, use it (instead of defaulting to the first unit in the box).

    Would be nice if changing sr17 didn't remove

    Refresh the colour in the ingredient box when you close the ingredient detail popup!

    Close the ingredient popup box after a successful save (Accept Match).

    Validation rules - what if you change sr17 and don't select a new unit?

    Add a view for updating the unit drop-down box whenever you change the food match choice.

    Units: if the user specifies a unit in the ingredient lookup form, we need to force this to be used.
        NO NEED - if you know the WEIGHT entry, you can get conversion factor without parsing at all: need to modify parse_units to accept a WEIGHT entry - avoid parsing units if we know for sure what to use.
        OK - need to add a weight entry field to the ingredient model to record this match
        OK - The values in the drop-down box should not be the pks of the WEIGHT entries, it's more flexible to keep make them text - we can add default weight units, etc that have no WEIGHT record.

    Also, lock the ingredient list for editing while the ingredient lookup form is open.
        No need since we're using modal popup.

    What to do if the user clicks on an ingredient that doesn't have a PK yet?
        DECISION: Simplifies things considerably if this is not allowed to happen.  <==============
        It would be nice if double-clicking on any ingredient saved it (even if a recipe pk is not yet available),
        that way you could tweak the text of the ingredient and then double-click to see the match, without clicking on Anaylyze nutrition again.

    If you change an ingredient in the ingredient box after running Analyze, then click ingredient detail view, it should check if there's any change
    in the description and parse it if so, before returning the ingredient form values.

    Quantity shows up in both places - what if you change the quantity in the ingredient lookup form, then in the recipe form!?!?!

    Make sure that if you created a new ingredient, you set the PK attribute of the li on the recipe page when you're done.
    Make sure that if you have a bunch of ingredients created with no recipe attached, that you attach the recipe if/when it finally gets created.
        Decision is that you have to hit Analyze Nutrition before you can open an ingredient in popup.

    Give message about double-clicking on ingredients only once you have a recipe PK

    If you create a new line by hitting enter at the end of an existing ingredient line, it seems to inherit the same confidence-class
    as the ingredient you hit enter on - that's not correct - you should only get confidence class on a saved ingredient.  The solution
    is to check for a new blank <li> on each edit to the ingredient box and strip it of any classes.

    Copying text from ingredient box and then pasting it back is not creating multiple <li>s.
        Could not reproduce.

    Ingredient box: If the user deletes everything and then backspaces, they delete all li's and nothing makes sense anymore.

    Error handling:
        If you change description of an existing ingredient to something with no db match, then double-click on it,
        you get an error returned via JSON - this should be displayed to the user (and the Accept Match key should be disabled).

    Thoroughly test failures:
        Totally unrecognized ingredient words.
        No quantity value - default to 1?

    Need our own human-readable name for each nutrient.

    We're not dividing by the number of servings yet!

    It's unacceptable to get the big red warning when you double-click on an ingredient (from previous error).

    Serves should default to 1 so that you can use the recipe form to experiment with single ingredients.
        1 is the model default, but this is not getting loaded when you open a blank recipe form because we're not sending the django ModelForm (just the blank template).
        Ugly hack - just setting it from JS.

    Modifying an ingredient using the popup should automatically recalculate the nutrition table.

    If you change an ingredient description, it should remove the "verified" flag and turn it back to pink.  Right now, it remains verified.
        Items with zero database match are not showing up in PINK!!!

    Escape double-quotes when putting data into attributes, for instance in values for drop-down box options on ingredient form.

    Need to update the pk attribute in the recipe box after creating a new ingredient on-the-fly.
        How to know which <li> to use?  Maybe store a reference to the li when you open the ingredient popup?  That's reasonable...
        Use line_num which comes back with data[].

    Would be nice to be allowed to double-click on a new ingredient as soon as you type it in...
        Must consider the case where there is no recipe id yet...  Save the ingredient, but later resave it when the ingredient gets analyzed, associating it with that recipe.
        Right now, ingredient <li>s are only made clickable during recipe form population. No way to attach an even to an <li> before the user creates it - must attach it afterward, by continuously checking for changes in div.

    Would be nice if ingredients turned pink as you edit the ingredient box, not only after you hit Analyze.
        Must compare state of each li after edit event - maybe just store the li's in an object (by pk) to record state.
            Or just clone the jQuery object wrapping the UL.

    If you click Analyze Nutrition on a recipe that's never been saved but the ingredients have been looked up, it will re-create those ingredients, not keep the confidence,etc. ingredient fields.
        Confidence is OK now, but not sr27 match.
        Also seems the nutrition table is empty.

    Modifying the text of an existing ingredient doesn't change its confidence level back to low (no server side activity involved).
        May have to maintain a clone of the ingredients <ul> after all.

    Change description of verified ingredient - it goes pink.  Then hit Analyze Nutrition - it goes back to white!!!

    Be sure to remove double-click event handler if you delete all the characters on a line in the ingredient box.
        Fixed, using jQuery .unbind()
        If you completely remove the <li> using delete or backspace, there's nothing to click on.

    parse_food should be clever enough to exclude unit-related words now!
        problem is that unit-related terms includes multi-word entries; remove these from the string before splitting into words?
        fix - enough to use "quantity_only_words" list, which consists of single words only.

    Why is "lemons, raw, etc"  matching better than "lemon grass (citronella)" for the search "lemon grass"?  Is it an issue with singularization?
        Bingo (all words in comma-sep position) is over-powering the "number of words matched" factor
        Fix: reduce bingo k factor from 100.0 to 50.0.

    No validation on serving number before using it.

    Might be nice to have an "Updated..." message that goes away, anytime the nutrition table gets hit.

    If you have a single ingredient, or if you're in solo mode, it should show N/A for any missing nutrient values....?

    Serious bug - on recipe 21, there are a number of squished <li>'s that still have PKs attached although there's no text in them!  These will count toward nutrition!
        Can't reproduce - maybe these ingredients with blank descriptions come from dev experiments...

    Solo mode.
        OK: Maybe install solo buttons after you click Analyze Nutrition, and remove them when you edit the ingredient box in any way.
        OK: CSS to darken the ingredients not being solo'd.
        OK: Clicking solo a second time (or clicking another solo button, or clicking Analyze Nutrition) should unsolo the solo.
        OK: Remove solo buttons if you edit the recipe box in any way.
            OK: We might not be removing buttons when user creates a new line.
        OK: Removing solo buttons should unsolo the box!  Otherwise we don't have a practical way to get out of solo mode...
        OK: Double-clicking an ingredient or hitting Analyze nutrition should unsolo the box the box, because we are re-displaying the nutrition quantities without solo.
            OK: Maybe it's sufficient that if display_nutrition is called without a solo pk, it unsolos the box...

    Message about double-clicking on pink ingredients should always be there (not just after the ingredient box gets loaded by ajax call.

    IU units for Vitamin A and D, while the targets are in terms of grams.
        Solution is to use "vitamin_a_rae" so it's compatible with the DRI targets, and
        convert Vitamin D from IU to Grams in the Nutrition table (the tabulated form of SR27, used in this project).

    Percentages (targets).
        Break out nutrient_set into a separate table?  That would standardize things...  Also nice to leave FOOD_DES alone.
            Link it to SR17 or to a table of target entries.
            User profiles <-> target table must have a two-directional relationship...  User profile will point to the specific target set to use.

    No target for energy
        kcal    DRI tables don't have it, use the DRI report 2005
        fat     DRI tables don't have it, use DRI report
        starch  Carb target instead?
        sugar   Carb target instead?

    Width of bars is wrong for anything less than about 20%.

    Next step is to get the ingredient popup form to validate correctly and transfer accepted ingredient into the main ingredient box.

    Any unavailable values should be sent from the server as null, and displayed in browser as N/A

    Can we dispense with the Calculate Nutrition button?  Clearly, it has to be recalculated any time the ingredient box changes...

    Changing number of servings should force recalc of nutrition table!
    Deleting an ingredient should also trigger recalculation.

    Right now, we don't show target/percentage bars for nutrient values that are not available (N/A).  Should probably show the
    bars at all times, and just display 0% or N/A on mouse-over for those.

    The many aliases of fat:
        nonfat, non-fat, non fat, lofat, low-fat, lo-fat, lowfat, low fat, etc.
        This problem is less important now with the Add Ingredient approach.

    Problem getting nutrition from saved recipe's ingredients - the WEIGHT.FOOD_DES doesn't match i.sr27...
        Critical bug fixed.

    Anything that calls calculate_nutrition() without passing parameters should clear the solo mode as well - should calculate_nutrition() take care of this?
        Add ingredient and Edit/Delete should remove solo mode.
        Make sure solo mode works properly in conjunction with setting a new target, etc.

    Ingredient box is not getting taller to accommodate ingredients added, even though autosize is called on the ul#ingredients-list

    Double-check that calculated values (for kcal) are correct (based on age).

    Always adjust ingredients by Refuse amount (skin, bones, etc.) using percent refuse in FOOD_DES.

    Poor error messages to user - should be clear if you can't reach the site, if the server throws an error, etc.

    Title of page should be updated as per recipe title if available.

    Saving and reloading page results in doubling the ingredient list!

    Let user save a recipe with no ingredients?  Why the hell not.

    Delete buttons to appear on Recipe list page, need a delete view as well.

    Nav bar link to create new recipe?  Or a green button everywhere?
