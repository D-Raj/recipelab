recipelab
=========

This repostory contains the source for recipelab.org, with two omissions.  The settings.py file for django is missing for security reasons, and the original USDA SR27 database .txt files were removed for
licensing reasons.  There are some dependencies that are not included here, including django_fastspring.

recipelab is a free nutrition calculator, created as a spare time project to learn django and to have some fun with the USDA's SR27 nutrition database.
